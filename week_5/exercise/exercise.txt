Use Chrome DevTools to inspect, modify, and debug a webpage.

1. Elements Tab Tasks (DOM & CSS Manipulation)
Demo File: css/css.html
Tasks:

Inspect the DOM:

Find the <p> tag and change its text to "Hello, DevTools!".

CSS Debugging:

Identify which CSS rule sets the paragraph color.

Disable one rule at a time to see how the color changes.

Add a new rule to make the text purple and set font-size: 20px.

Box Model:

Increase the padding of the <p> tag to 20px and observe the Box Model visualization.

Delete the <p> tag from the DOM, then undo it (Ctrl+Z/Cmd+Z).






2. Console Tab Tasks (JavaScript Interaction)
Tasks:

Use $0:

Inspect the <p> tag, then in the Console:

Change its text: $0.textContent = "I love DevTools!";

Make its background lightblue.

window Object:

Create a global variable: window.studentName = "Your Name";

Log it: console.log(studentName);





3. Network Tab Tasks (HTTP Requests Analysis)
Demo File: demo/demo.html (intentionally broken to trigger a 404)
Tasks:

Monitor Requests:

Open the Network tab, then refresh the page.

Find the failed request for styles.css (status 404).

Headers Analysis:

Click the request and identify:

Request Headers: User-Agent, Accept.

Response Headers: Status, Content-Type.

Fix the Error:

In the Sources tab, correct the path to styles.css and save (Overrides).
