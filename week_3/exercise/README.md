11. The PR should be between main branch and your feature branch.
12. Wait until automated tests run to check your code.
- If the tests pass successfully, merge your PR.
- If the tests fail, check the details to identify which answer is not correct.
- Fix the issue locally and push the new changes to GitHub.
13. If your tests passed and you merged your PR, add a link to your repo into Blackboard as submission for this assignment.

### Run tests locally

You can check your work locally before pushing your changes to GitHub.

Install all necessary modules for testing:
- npm install

Run Cypress tests:
- npx cypress run


### How To Set Up SSH

#### MacOS

1. **Generate an SSH key on your machine:**

   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email"

- Replace "your_email" with the email address associated with your GitHub account.
- When prompted with "Enter file in which to save the key", type github as the file name and press Enter. Do not change the location.
- When prompted for a passphrase, leave it empty and press Enter twice.

This will generate an SSH key pair. To confirm, list the files in the `~/.ssh` directory:

`ls ~/.ssh`

You should see:

`github` (your private key)
`github.pub` (your public key)

There may be other files in this directory as well.

2. **Add your public key to your GitHub account**

- Log in to GitHub.
- Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner, then select Settings.
- In the left sidebar, select SSH and GPG keys.
- Click New SSH key.

For the Title, use something descriptive (e.g., "MacBook Air Key" to indicate this key was generated on your MacBook Air).
For Key type, leave it as "Authentication key."
To get the key, run the following command in the terminal to display the contents of your github.pub file:

`cat ~/.ssh/github.pub`

Copy the output (your public key) and paste it into the Key field on GitHub, then click Add SSH key.

3. **Add your private key to the SSH agent**

First, start the SSH agent by running:

`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

Then, add your private key to the agent:

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/github`

Make sure you're adding the private key (`github`), not the public key (`github.pub`).

4. **Verify that the key has been added**

To check that your key was added successfully, run:

`ssh-add -l -E sha256`

This should display your key, confirming that it's been added.

5. **Test the connection to GitHub:**

To verify that your SSH setup works, run:

`ssh -T git@github.com`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a welcome message with your GitHub username.

6. **Set up SSH agent to start automatically**

To ensure the SSH agent starts automatically every time you open a terminal, you need to add the following lines to your shell profile.

First, check which shell you’re using:

`echo $SHELL`

If the output is `/bin/bash`, you're using Bash. In that case, create or update the .bash_profile file in your home directory (`~`):

Add the following lines to the file:

`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
`ssh-add ~/.ssh/github`

Save the file and restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

If you're using a different shell (e.g., Zsh), you'll need to update the appropriate shell configuration file (e.g., .zshrc).

#### Windows

1. **Generate an SSH key on your machine:**

   Open PowerShell (or Command Prompt) and run the following commands:

   `mkdir $HOME\.ssh`
   `cd $HOME\.ssh`
   `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email"`

- Replace "your_email" with the email address associated with your GitHub account.
- When prompted with "Enter file in which to save the key", type github as the file name and press Enter. Do not change the location.
- When prompted for a passphrase, leave it empty and press Enter twice.

This will generate an SSH key pair. To confirm, and you should see:

`github` (your private key)
`github.pub` (your public key)

2. **Add your public key to your GitHub account**

- Log in to GitHub.
- Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner, then select Settings.
- In the left sidebar, select SSH and GPG keys.
- Click New SSH key.

For the Title, use something descriptive (e.g., "Windows Key" to indicate this key was generated on your Windows).
For Key type, leave it as "Authentication key."
To get the key, run the following command in PowerShell to display the contents of your github.pub file:

`Get-Content $HOME\.ssh\github.pub`

Copy the output (your public key) and paste it into the Key field on GitHub, then click Add SSH key.

3. **Add your private key to the SSH agent**

First, start the SSH agent by running:

`Start-Service ssh-agent`

Then, add your private key to the agent:

`ssh-add $HOME\.ssh\github`

Make sure you're adding the private key (`github`), not the public key (`github.pub`).

4. **Verify that the key has been added**

To check that your key was added successfully, run:

`ssh-add -l -E sha256`

This should display your key, confirming that it's been added.

5. **Test the connection to GitHub:**

To verify that your SSH setup works, run:

`ssh -T git@github.com`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a welcome message with your GitHub username.

6. **Set up SSH agent to start automatically**

To ensure the SSH agent starts automatically every time you open a terminal, you need to add the following lines to your PowerShell profile.

Open PowerShell and check which profile file is being used:

`$PROFILE`

This will display the path to your PowerShell profile file.

Open the profile file in a text editor and add the following lines to the file:

`Start-Service ssh-agent`
`ssh-add $HOME\.ssh\github`

Save the file and restart your PowerShell for the changes to take effect.
